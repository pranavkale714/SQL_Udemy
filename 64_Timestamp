    -- What's the difference between DATETIME and TIMESTAMP?
 
-- They both store datetime information, but there's a difference in the range, 
-- TIMESTAMP has a smaller range. TIMESTAMP also takes up less space. 
-- TIMESTAMP is used for things like meta-data about when something is created
-- or updated.
